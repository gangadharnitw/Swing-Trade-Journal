### Trade-001: UGI Corporation (UGI)

#### 1. Setup & Thesis
* **Date of Entry:** July 8, 2025
* **Strategy:** Trend-Following / "Buy the Dip"
* **Thesis Rationale:** The trade is based on a high-probability technical setup. UGI is in a strong, established uptrend and has pulled back to its 50-day moving average. This moving average has served as a reliable support level throughout the entire rally. The expectation is for the price to bounce from this support and resume its primary uptrend. The risk/reward profile is favorable.

* **Scenario 3 (Profit Target 2):** Allow the final 100 shares to run, capitalizing on a potential breakout to new highs. The stop at $35.30 will protect the position.
